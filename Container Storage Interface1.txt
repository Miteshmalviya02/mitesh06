                                               Container Stroage Interface:

*Introduction:
container stroage interface is standard interface for orchestration system to interact with storage system.

container stroage interface is invented by CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) and many
industires including Google.This project was created for interact with storage system,kubernets is an 
example for conatiner orchestration system.

The contribution of google in this project was they provided reference implimentation for kubernetes by 
interact with various storage system.
CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) was one who started the project then later many industries 
started contributed in this project.

*Uses Cases:
1)Data aggegation.
2)Data consolation.
3)Obserability.

*Features:
1) Easy to understand 
2)User Friendly
3)Logging
4)Monitoring
5)Scalability
6)Accessability
7)Multi-value
8)Sanpshorting
9)Cloning
10)Merging

*Before CSI:
Before CSI there were many storage system but it was very difficult to maintain large amount data,CSI was 
invented in Dec 2017 by cncf and many comapanies including Google.

*Project Summary:
Foundation/Organization:Google
Licence:Apache2.0
Brief Summary:container stroage interface is standard interface for orchestration system to interact with storage system.

*Technical Deatils:
CSI was invented in Dec 2017 by CNCF and many comapanies including Google,the main work of conatiner storage interface 
is inserting ,deleting, merging etc. in a storage system.

*Architectrue:
Container Stroage Interface is main used for Storing the data 
1) CSI Plugin.
2)CSI Driver.
